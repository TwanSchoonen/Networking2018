The first thing to do is to run mapapp (Map/mapapp.py). This will open map's main page, where centers are shown. Initially, the image is blank.

To create a center, open a new terminal window, and run the script center (App/center.py). The input needed to create a center is name, number of cars, and port used. After completion, a new center is added to map's main page. Clicking the circle with the center's name displays a city map with cars (as many as specified above) randomly moving around the city.
To return map main page, press 'b'.

To add a costumer, open app (App/app.py)
